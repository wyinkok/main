== Introduction

JobbiBot is a desktop Chatbot application for those who *prefer to use an interactive app to source for internship
opportunities*. Hence, JobbiBot is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while
still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, JobbiBot can find the most suitable
internship matches faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `jobbibot.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your JobbiBot.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI like the one below should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command `start` in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] if you would like to begin a conversation with JobbiBot.
.  Alternatively, if you would like to search for an internship directly. Type your command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +

.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`help`* : open the help window
* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`save`**`3` : save the 3rd contact shown in the current list to a personal Saved Collection
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for more details of each command.
