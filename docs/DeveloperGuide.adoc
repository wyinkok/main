By: `Team CS2103-F11-B3`      Since: `Jan 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/InternshipBook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/InternshipBook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `InternshipBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
// tag::ui[]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagramv1.5.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `BrowserPanel`, `ChatBotListPanel`, `InternshipListPanel`, `HelpWindow` and `StatusBarFooter`.

All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `ChatBotPanel` displays the full message thread between Jobbi and the end user in a JavaFX list view . Each `ChatBotCard` is a single message either from Jobbi or the user. Messages will alternate between Jobbi and user, which means that for every user command entered, Jobbi will respond to it.
// end::ui[]

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

.Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in <<fig-LogicClassDiagram>>
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `InternshipBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a internship) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.


[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelComponentClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Internship Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Internship>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Internship Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.InternshipBook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::filter[]
=== Filter Feature
==== Implementation

The search and filter command are two complementary features of the JobbiBot.

The search command takes in one or more keywords and returns all internships that contains *ANY* of the keyword(s).

The filter command takes in one or more keywords and returns all internships that contains *ALL* of the keyword(s) from the last searched internship list or the full internship list if the users has not used the search command feature.


==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Old Implementation of `Filter Command`

* Saved the list searched keyword argument(s) into a List<String> and add these arguments into the filter command arguments.

** Example: `search marketing`, then `filter singapore` is essentially `filter marketing singapore` since filter only returns arguments that contains all the given keywords
** Rationale 1: Provides two unique function, one to union find all the keyword arguments, whereas the other is a inner join / intersect find of all the keyword arguments.
** Rationale 2: More intuitive for the user to only key in `filter singapore` to get `filter singapore marketing` results after he/she have `search marketing`
** Pros: Easy to implement, only need to create a List<String> to store the last searched arguments and add them to the filter command arguments when filter commmand is executed
** Cons: Fatal design error in the following example: `search marketing analytics`, then `filter singapore` will only return results that contain marketing analytics and singapore.
Whereas the desired output should be internships that either contain marketing singapore or analytics singapore. It was not feasible/easy to change the filter command to produce this desired outcome

===== Aspect: Alternative Implementation 'Filter Command'

* Alternative implementation to solve the above problem was to add a tag called CurrentList whatever is being currently searched.
Regardless of how many search arguments were given in the initial search command, the list will all have the CurrentList tag which allows for easy filtering
as we can simply add CurrentList tag to the filter keywords.

** Example: `Search marketing analytics data engineering` followed by a `filter singapore` will result in `filter singapore CurrentList`
which returns all internships that contains (marketing or analytics or data or engineering) and singapore.
** Pros: Make use of existing Tag Feature. Supposedly easier to implement than changing the model component to save the last searched internship list somewhere and apply filter on it.
** Cons: Will be distracting as the CurrentList tag is applied to the entire list
** Cons: Was harder to implement than expected because the tag had to be cleared
** Note: This add tag feature (done by Ci Kang) is now used to distinguish between search keywords.
E.g `search marketing analytics` will display marketing tag for internship that contain marketing and display analytics tag for internship that contains analytics.


===== Aspect: Current Implementation 'Filter Command'
* Current implementation makes use of the Java FXCollections filteredList.
We created a separate FilteredList<Internship> called SearchedInternshipList and used it together with the existing FilteredList<Internship> FilteredIntership.
Thus we have an InternshipBook , a filteredList (called searchedInternships) which wraps around the InternshipBook, and a filteredList (called filteredInternships) which wraps around the searchedInternship. See code snippet below

----
public class ModelManager extends ComponentManager implements Model {
	...
    private final InternshipBook jobbiBot;
    private final FilteredList<Internship> searchedInternships;
    private final FilteredList<Internship> filteredInternships;
    ...

    public ModelManager(ReadOnlyInternshipBook jobbiBot, UserPrefs userPrefs) {
    	....
    	....
        this.jobbiBot = new InternshipBook(jobbiBot);
        searchedInternships = new FilteredList<>()
        filteredInternships = new FilteredList<>(searchedInternships);
        ...
    }

----

Due to the java wrapper functionality (in the FilteredList<T>), any changes in InternshipBook is propagated down to searchedInternship and then to filteredInternship. This allows us to maintain two different list of internships according to whatever keyword arguments (predicate) have been applied to it.

Additional helper methods were then created to differentiate between updating of the searchedInternship and filteredInternship. See code snippet 2 below


	// For Filter function
    @Override
    public void updateFilteredInternshipList(Predicate<Internship> predicate) {
        requireNonNull(predicate);
        filteredInternships.setPredicate(predicate);
    }

    // For Search Function
    @Override
    public void updateSearchedInternshipList(Predicate<Internship> predicate) {
        requireNonNull(predicate);
        searchedInternships.setPredicate(predicate);
        filteredInternships.setPredicate(predicate);
    }
---

With this, the search and filter function can now work as intended. `search marketing analytics` and `filter singapore` will return results containing (marketing or analytics) and singapore

See Diagram below: <Insert Diagram to show how the propagation works here>

** Pros: Design feature solved in relatively "easy" way without having to change the existing code significantly
** Cons: Was harder to implement as it required knowledge of how the model interacts and worked as well as how the filteredList Java FXCollection worked.


// end::filter[]

// tag::chatbot[]
=== Chatbot Feature
The Chatbot is the key UI feature of this application. Through the Chatbot, JobbiBot, students will receive guidance
and step-by-step prompts on how to narrow down their internship search. They are able to communicate with JobbiBot using the CLI.
This is an important feature for our target users because they may not always know how to begin their search or what to look for.

==== Current (Main) Implementation
Each message is displayed within a ListCell, otherwise named as a `ChatBotCard` in JobbiBot. A `ChatBotCard` is made up of a JavaFX HBox class that consists of a Label class.
The Label is used to either display a Jobbi message or an user command input. This mechanism inherits from UiPart and is executed by the UiManager.

When a new event is raised, typically when a user keys in a command, there are three main methods that handle Jobbi and user responses in order to render the conversation between Jobbi and the user on the ListView.

The first method to handle each user input in the command box is `handleUserResponse`.
----
    public ObservableList<String> handleUserResponse(ObservableList<String> listToUpdateWithUserResponse) {
        ...

        // Checks if user has typed the `start` command and adds the current element in the history snapshot list to the ObservableList<String>
        if (historySnapshot.hasElement("start")) {
            listToUpdateWithUserResponse.add("USER:   " + historySnapshot.current());

        // ... Checks if user has restarted conversation if Jobbi ...

        // Returns the updated list which is used in the `buildConversation` method to render the updated ListView
        return listToUpdateWithUserResponse;
    }
----
The second method to handle each Jobbi's response is `handleJobbiResponse`.

----
    public ObservableList<String> handleJobbiResponse(ObservableList<String> listToUpdateWithJobbiResponse,
                                                      String message) {
        ...
        // Checks if the user has typed in `start` command to initiate conversation and add the message returned from the EventBus
        if (historySnapshot.hasElement("start")) {
            listToUpdateWithJobbiResponse.add("JOBBI:  " + message);

        // ... Checks if user has restarted conversation if Jobbi ...

          // Returns the updated list which is used in the `buildConversation` method to render the updated ListView
        return listToUpdateWithJobbiResponse;
    }
----

Finally, the last method takes an ObservableList of strings which has been updated with the both latest Jobbi and user response to an event
and renders a new ListView of the message thread.
----
    public void buildConversation(ObservableList<String> listToBuild) {

        // Maps each message in the updated ObservableList<String> to a ChatBotCard
        ObservableList<ChatBotCard> mappedList = EasyBind.map(
                updatedMessages, (msg) -> new ChatBotCard(msg));

        // ... Recreates the ListView with the new user input ...
    }
----

==== Design Considerations
A JavaFX ListView class was specifically chosen because it allows for the vertical display of items, such a message thread.
A ListView instance is buildable with many ListCell objects so a message thread between Jobbi and user can grow extensively.
It also enables scrolling so that the user is able to scroll up and down to view his or her chat history.

However, two main aspects of the ListView class was altered so that it resembles a message thread:

* The ability to select a list cell was disabled since users should not be able to to select individual messages.
* Auto-scrolling to the latest message was added so that users will always see the latest message on the ListView first.

// end::chatbot[]

// tag::saveunsave[]
=== Save/Unsave Feature
==== Current Implementation

The save/unsave mechanism is facilitated by the addition of a `saved` tag or removal of the `saved` tag
respectively. Inspired by the Instagram saved feature, it allows our users to personally curate specific
internships that they would like to save for a quick reference in the future as opposed to re-searching for
a particular internship again.

However, the special part of this feature is that users do not add or remove the `saved` tags in the CLI.
Instead, they simply type in the command `save` or `unsave` followed by an index number and the command internally
adds a new "saved" tag to the internship or remove the tag. This mechanism inherits from `UndoableCommand` and is
executed by the `LogicManager`.

To achieve the internal addition of a saved tag, we added an `addSavedTagToInternship` method
within the SaveCommand object. This method is self-invocated by the object's other methods, such as `preprocessUndoableCommand`.
----
private Internship addSavedTagToInternship(Internship internship) throws CommandException {

        //Creates a UniqueTagList of the specific internship's tags only
        final UniqueTagList internshipTags = new UniqueTagList(internshipToSave.getTags());

        //Adds a 'saved' tag only to internships that do not already possess the 'saved' tag or else an exception is thrown
        try {
            personTags.add(new Tag(SAVED_TAG));
        } catch (UniqueTagList.DuplicateTagException e) {
            throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_SAVED_INTERNSHIP);
        }

        // ... rebuilds the updated list of tags ...

        // returns an internship with all the same information except for an additional "saved" tag
        return new Internship(
                internship.getName(), internship.getPhone(), internship.getEmail(), internship.getAddress(), correctTagReferences);
    }
----
The execution of this method in the `SaveCommand` object affects
the `Model` and `UI` by adding a visible `saved` tag to a specific internship. The result of the `SaveCommand`
execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to UI.

Below is a Sequence Diagram that demonstrates the interaction within the `Logic` component for the
`execute("saved 1")`.

image::SaveCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Similarly, to achieve the internal removal of a saved tag, we added a `removeSavedTagToInternship` method
within the UnsaveCommand object. The implementation of this method and its concept is exactly the opposite of
the SaveCommand since the `saved` tag is being removed.

----
    private Internship removeSavedTagToInternship(Internship internship) {

        //Creates a UniqueTagList of the specific internship's tags only
        final UniqueTagList internshipTags = new UniqueTagList(internshipToUnsave.getTags());

        //Checks for an existing "saved" tag and removes it from the UniqueTagList
        internshipTags.delete(new Tag(SAVED_TAG));

        // ... rebuilds the new list of tags and returns same person object without "saved" tag  ...
    }

----

==== Design Considerations

With the `saved` tag, users are able to identify the internships they have saved in their personal collection in the `InternshipCardPanel`.
When users want to remove the internship from their collection, they can type the `unsave` command to remove the tag.
To view the entire collection, they can type `find saved` or `filter saved` into the CLI that basically searches for all the
internships with "saved" tags and displays the filtered list.

We chose to use the addition and removal of tags for two main reasons:

* It is visible to the user which internship has been saved or unsaved.
* It is more straightforward in terms of implementation to do a search by a specific tag to display the Saved Collection.
* Users are able to further narrow down on their search from the Saved Collection. For example, `find saved business` will return a filtered list of internships
in the Saved Collection that are related to the business industry.

===== Alternative Solution 1: Readapt the existing Implementation of the `edit` Command
The `edit` command allowed users to edit the tags of a specific existing internship. We could have potentially used it to add the `saved` tag to specific internships

*** Pros: Much simpler implementation since the `edit` command has been provided by the Address Book 4.
*** Cons 1: Editing tags with the `edit` command erase previous tags from the internship but we want to add the `saved` tag to the existing tags.
*** Cons 2: The command line input is relatively less user-friendly. For example, the user had to input `edit 1 t/saved` to add `saved` tag to the first internship of the filtered list.
On the other hand, the `save` command only requires the user to type in `save 1` for the same outcome.

===== Alternative Solution 2: Create an additional model
Another idea was to create separate Internship Book Model and its own storage for the Saved Collections

*** Pros: Able to save in hard disk storage
*** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage and may have to significantly change the architecture

// end::saveunsave[]


// tag::findwithfeatures[]

=== Find Command with Adding Tag Feature

==== Rationale
As the current find command work like a union search, users are able to key in multiple keywords at one go and JobbiBot will show
all the internships that matches at least one of the keywords. However, users will not be able to differentiate which
internships matches which keywords they have keyed in. As such this new feature enables them to have a clearer picture of
which internship suits them more and enable them to further filter from the list.

==== Current Implementation

The add tag feature is implemented as part of the find command. However, as models will be change due to the addition of tags,
some codes are implemented within ModelManager.

image::FindCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="1200"]

As it can be seen from the diagram, `Logic` uses the `InternshipBookParser` class to parse the user command.
After which, `FindCommandParser` is created and use to parse the keyword. The keyword is then set in `ModelManager` via the
setKeywords() method. A `FindCommand` object is then created followed by the `internshipContainsKeywordsPredicate`.

In the second phase, the command is being executed in `FindCommand`. The first updateSearchedInternshipList() update the
searchedInternship with all the internships available and remove all tags from them apart from `saved` tags. Following which
the second updateSearchedInternshipList() update the searchedInternshipList with the internships that matches the keywords
use as the argument in `FindCommand`. Those keywords are then added to the respective internships that matches it through the
addTagsToFilteredList(). `FindCommand` then execute getCommandResult() and return the result of the command execution encapsulated
as a `CommandResult` object and returns it to the `LogicManager` and subsequently to the UI and displayed to the user.

==== Design Considerations

Initial: Adding the addition and removal of tags from internship method under `FindCommand` since it is ultimately used when executing FindCommand.

Refinement: Since the addition and removal of tags to internship involves modifying of internship, these methods are added to the
internship class as shown below. An additional check for `saved` tag was added as well as from the users perspective, they would
want to search for other internship while keeping those that are searched before with the `saved` tag.

----
    public Internship removeTagsFromInternship() {
        final UniqueTagList internshipTags = new UniqueTagList(getTags());

        for (Tag tagToBeRemoved : tags) {
            if (!tagToBeRemoved.toString().equals(SAVED_TAG_NAME)) {
                try {
                    internshipTags.delete(tagToBeRemoved);
                } catch (TagNotFoundException e) {
                    assert false;
                    throw new AssertionError("Impossible! Should not have TagNotFoundException");
                }
            }
        }

        ...
        ...

        return new Internship(
                getName(), getSalary(), getEmail(), getAddress(),
                getIndustry(), getRegion(), getRole(), correctTagReferences);
    }

    public Internship addTagsToInternship(String keyword) {
        final UniqueTagList internshipTags = new UniqueTagList(getTags());

        try {
            internshipTags.add(new Tag(keyword));
        } catch (UniqueTagList.DuplicateTagException e) {
            throw new AssertionError("Operation would result in duplicate tags");
        }
        ...
        ...

        return new Internship(
                getName(), getSalary(), getEmail(), getAddress(),
                getIndustry(), getRegion(), getRole(), correctTagReferences);
    }
----

Implementation of the codes

Initial: To implement the addTagsToFilteredList method, a double for loop was used to loop through both keywords and internships
in order to find the match and proceed with the addition of tags to the internship.

----
    public static void addTagsToFilteredList (List<String> filterKeywords,
                                              ObservableList<Internship> filteredInternships, Model model)
            throws CommandException {

        for (String keywords : filterKeywords) {
            for (Internship filteredInternship : filteredInternships) {
                if (StringUtil.containsWordIgnoreCase(filteredInternship.toString(), keywords)) {
                    try {
                        model.updateInternship(filteredInternship,
                                addTagsToInternshipWithMatch(keywords, filteredInternship));
                    } catch (DuplicateInternshipException e) {
                        throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_INTERNSHIP);
                    } catch (InternshipNotFoundException e) {
                        throw new AssertionError("The target internship cannot be missing");
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
----

Code Refinement: However, there were SRP violation there as the method was used to find internship that is matching the keyword,
add the keyword tag and also update the internship. Furthermore, the code was deeply nested as well. As such, concept of abstraction
was used to separate the functions into individual methods as shown below.
----
    public CommandResult execute() {
        model.removeTagsFromAllInternshipList();
        model.updateSearchedInternshipList(predicate);
        model.addTagsToFilteredList();
        return getCommandResult();
    }
----

==== Additional Enhancement

From the users perspective, they might want to find again if the result was not up to their satisfaction.
As such, the implementation was designed in such a way that subsequent find will reset the tags from the internship.

Since List command is used to show the entire list in the display, a feature is added to it such that all the tags are removed from the internships
to allow the user to see the entire internship list.
----
    public void removeTagsFromFilteredList() {
        for (Internship internship : getFilteredInternshipList()) {
            try {
                updateInternship(internship, internship.removeTagsFromInternship());
            } catch (DuplicateInternshipException e) {
                throw new AssertionError(MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_SAVED_INTERNSHIP);
            } catch (InternshipNotFoundException e) {
                throw new AssertionError("The target internship cannot be missing");
            }
        }
    }
----
Rather than throwing exception, assertion is used instead because users do not key in the value but instead, downloads
the internship book and insert it into the program. As such, there should not be any duplicate internship. Any duplicate internships
will result in the program malfunctioning and no internship being listed on the left panel.
// end::findwithfeatures[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th internship in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new internship.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the internship was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `UndoableCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`
** Pros: We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist.
** Cons: Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.
* **Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()`
** Pros: Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand.
** Cons: Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the internship being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


===== Aspect: Type of commands that can be undone/redone

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`).
** Pros: We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are * lost).
** Cons: User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), * only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`.
* **Alternative 2:** Include all commands.
** Pros: Might be more intuitive for the user.
** Cons: User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address * book and not the view.
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/InternshipBook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].


===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo
** Pros: Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be * the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update * both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two * different things.
// end::undoredo[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
